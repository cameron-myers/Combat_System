Description:
	This file is part of the framework for the 1D Combat Simulator assignment in
	DES 212 (System Design Methods). It can be freely used and modified by students
	for that assignment.
	
    This component will control the X scale any game object it is added to (even if it
	isn't actually a bar). In particular, it will keep track of the original scale and
	allow other code to just give it the percentage of that original scale that is
	desired (and can interpolate the scale to the new value over time if desired).
