	This file is part of the framework for the 1D Combat Simulator assignment in
	DES 212 (System Design Methods). It can be freely used and modified by students
	for that assignment.
	
    This component makes a game object an enemy. These are dynamically spawned at
    the start of each round by the SimControl script.
