Description:
	This file is part of the framework for the 1D Combat Simulator assignment in
	DES 212 (System Design Methods). It can be freely used and modified by students
	for that assignment.
	
    This component controls the entire combat simulation. This component is added to
    a game object whose only purpose to contain this functionality, but using a
    ScriptedObject would potentially be a more advanced	way of doing this.
